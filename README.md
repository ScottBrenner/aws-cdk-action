# GitHub Action for AWS CDK

This Action for [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html) enables arbitrary actions for interacting with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) via the [AWS CDK Command Line Interface (`cdk`)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html).

_Currently supports CDK apps created with Python and JavaScript_

## Usage

An example workflow for synthesizing an AWS CloudFormation template for your app using `cdk synth`.

```yaml
name: AWS CDK Synth

on: [push]

jobs:
  aws-cdk-synth:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: CDK Synth
      uses: scottbrenner/aws-cdk-action@master
      with:
        args: synth
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

### Secrets

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` – **Required** The AWS access key part of your credentials ([more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys))
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` – **Required** The AWS secret access key part of your credentials ([more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys))

For details on creating secrets and using them with GitHub Actions, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

### Environment

Each Stack instance in your AWS CDK app is explicitly or implicitly associated with an environment (`env`). An environment is the target AWS account and AWS Region into which this stack needs to be deployed.

See [the CDK developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html) for more information.
